This is a minimal Ruby command-line app which generates Github Issues from
Trello cards. Currently lacks help, error handling, intelligent argument
parsing, modularity, and so on.

## Installing

Just rename config\_example.yml to config.yml and fill in your own values.

## Usage

`ruby trello_github.rb <trello_card_url>`

`trello_card_url` is the URL shown in the URL bar when a card is displayed. It
should look something like `https://trello.com/card/name-of-card/4f1836c0c3c5f3d82f08e4bd/77`.
